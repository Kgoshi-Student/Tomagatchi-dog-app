# Tomagatchi-dog-app

This readme file is about the Tamagotchi App™ designed and created by Kgoshi Ntsoane. This app will allow you to create and take care of a virtual pet by using certain action buttons. The main objective is to not let all three values of Hunger, Cleanliness and Happiness fall to 0%. You will first be introduced to the welcome screen in which there will be a button that says “Play!” Once this clicked you will be taken to a second screen where there is a default picture of your virtual pet along with default values for the Hunger, Cleanliness and Happiness meters. There is also three buttons to manage to these meters, namely the “Feed”, “play” and “clean” buttons. Clicking each of these will reduce or increase the various meters’ values.
You will need a device with Android 9.0, 8GB RAM, 50MB Storage to install this.
